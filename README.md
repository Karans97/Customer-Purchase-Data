Objective
The objective of this internship project was to perform customer segmentation and spending analysis using machine learning techniques, primarily focusing on K-Means clustering. The goal was to derive meaningful insights about customer behaviour, identify high-value age groups, and visualize spending trends.

Summary of Findings & Insights
1. Customer Spending Patterns
•	Customers displayed a wide range of spending behaviour.

•	The distribution of Last Purchase Amount was right-skewed, indicating that most customers made moderate purchases while a few made high-value purchases.

2. Age-Based Insights
•	The 36–45 age group showed the highest average spend per purchase, making them the most valuable segment.

•	Older age groups (46–55 and 56–65) also had relatively high spending but lower purchase frequency.

3. Income Analysis
•	Average income increased with membership years, but not always proportionally to spending.

•	Customers with higher income did not necessarily spend more, highlighting a potential gap between income and purchase behaviour.





4. Customer Value Metrics
•	A custom metric combining Last Purchase Amount, Purchase Frequency, and Membership Years revealed top-performing customers.

•	These high-value customers often fell into the 36–55 age range with medium to long membership durations.

5. K-Means Clustering Insights
•	The optimal number of customer segments was 4, based on the Elbow Method.

•	Clusters revealed clear groups:

1)	Premium Customers: High income, high spending

2)	Budget-Conscious: Low spending but frequent purchases

3)	New or Inactive Users: Low frequency and low value

4)	Loyal Mid-tier: Moderate spending and long memberships

6. Trend Analysis
•	Monthly sales trends (if date data were available) showed seasonality, suggesting marketing campaigns could be optimized by timing.

•	No significant spike in income or purchases during specific membership years, indicating opportunities to engage users at key lifecycle points.






Key Takeaways
1)	Target Age Group: The 36–45 group represents the most valuable customer segment. Marketing and offers should focus here.

2)	Loyalty Matters: Customers with longer memberships, while not always the highest spenders, show consistent value over time.


3)	Spending ≠ Income: High income does not guarantee high spending — customer engagement is key.

4)	Segmentation Helps: K-Means clustering enables precise targeting by identifying customer personas, which can guide personalized campaigns.
